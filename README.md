## Abstract
People tend to invest because of the low deposit rate in the COVID-19 period. It gave us 
the insights to create a bank-like investment tool to meet such customer demand. It features 
customer service, financial service, and supportive product supply. To achieve this, we 
design the conceptual model via the EER model and UML language. Then, we map the 
relational model in a normalized way. Next, databases like MySQL, MongoDB, Neo4j are 
generated with some fake data, and queries with questions like the information of customers, 
financial expectation of users and annual profits for companies. We also use Python to 
access the MySQL database and visualize the demo result using matplotlib package and 
tableau.
